# Real Time Weather Application
This is a weather application that shows realtime weather with forecast for the next 1 week and 
weather history of previous 2 weeks.

## Dependency Management

Separated dependencies in **buildSrc** for better management, re-usability and easy maintenance. 
This approach is most effected when project has multiple modules therefore, the common dependencies 
can be implemented in **buildSrc** which can be used in all modules.

## Separation of DataClasses

UI dataclasses are separated from network dataclasses for the separation of concern.
This helps to maintain and easy-to handle data for both UI and API calls.
